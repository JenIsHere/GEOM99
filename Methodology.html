    <p class="generalText">This phase of the project will be ongoing throughout the planning stages of our project. JPC will continually collect data of various file formats from various sources as well as research the topic as it continues to evolve. Data collected will include key elements for visualization as well as informative land use data and census data to guide Spatial Analysis. Additional researched topics will include perspectives from various stakeholders in the efforts to conserve the Whitebelt and those opposing urban sprawl, but also looking into extracting value from published projections on the growth of the Greater Golden Horseshoe area.</p>

    <h1 class="homeSubHead" id="Creating a Basemap">Creating a Basemap in Mapbox</h1>
    <p class="generalText"> To create a visually appealing webmap, the team needed a good basemap. Being limited to open-source software, JPC decided to utilize Mapbox for creation of a basemap as per requirements. </p>
    <p class="generalText"> After following a few tutorials, we were able to put together a basemap, or a style, as Mapbox defines it. Though this one didn't do any justice to our theme as it was created from a template which made it so that a lot of unnecessary data.</p>
    <div class="methimg">
      <img class="methimg" src="Images/basemap1.png" alt="First basemap">
    </div>
    <p class="generalText">This basemap didn't do justice to what the team wanted to visualize and so we chose to create a basemap from a blank template.</p>
    <p class="generalText"> With cartographic principles in mind, the team created a "style" which would make the viewer focus on the actual content of the layers to be added.</p>
    <div class="methimg">
      <img class="methimg" src="Images/basemap2.png" alt="Second basemap">
    </div>
    <p class="generalText">With a positive response from all the members, this basemap was finalized.</p>
    <p class="generalText">Now, to add more context to the basemap, the members decided to try and figure out how to add data to Mapbox styles and symbolize it. For this, a demo dataset was used and points were placed on the basemap, with their markers able to be edited.</p>
    <div class="methimg">
      <img class="methimg" src="Images/basemap3.png" alt="Second basemap with markers">
    </div>
    <p class="generalText">With successful implementation of markers, the group chose to explore more features to create an interactive experience for the viewer.</p>
    <p class="generalText">As such, the team decided to tackle the task of creating a slideshow gallery in a marker tooltip, which would allow the user to switch between contextual images associated with the marker location. Here, we also tried to customise the markers with symbols and colours.</p>

    <h1 class="homeSubHead" id="Spatial Analysis">Spatial Analysis</h1>
    <p class="generalText">The Spatial Analysis phase of this project will support objective 2 of our project and will be a key factor of all three deliverables. This phase of the project has been broken down into three key sections to guide our multi criteria decision analysis of the Core Greater Golden Horseshoe region. Three key elements of the Spatial analysis will overlap to ensure there is flexibility to refine each aspect before moving to far ahead. Firstly, we will need to define effective criteria in which to base our analysis on. This will include categorizing existing lands based on current land use, soil structure, key demographic indicators, and projections for urban growth of the area. Once we have established the criteria, we will begin to build models and obtain test results to further refine our methodology and process as needed. Once we are satisfied with our test results, we will look to execute the analysis across the entirety of the study area all the while ensuring an accurate and informative result.</p>

    <h1 class="homeSubHead" id="Interactive Web Visualization">Interactive Web and Static Map Visualization</h1>
    <p class="generalText" id="Static Map Visualization">The Visualization phases of our project will be ongoing throughout the delivery of the final solutions. Our client has requested a visualization of the study area to be used as a tool to raise public awareness. We will look to meet this deliverable by providing an interactive web map as well as a supporting static map. The interactive web map will be developed using open-source technology and be delivered as a website that can be linked or embedded directly to their organizationâ€™s website. The interactive map will aim to tell a story, visualizing the results of our analysis as well as the additional information gathered through research of key metrics and the impacts of urban sprawl on the Greater Golden Horseshoe Area.  The interactive web map will be developed in stages along other key elements of the analysis. First creating the host webpage, incorporating base layers, then moving to including the results of our analysis as interactive layers and completing the story by adding in the additional information found from research and our analysis. The purpose of the static map is to provide an appealing, all-encompassing view of the study area to be viewed offline. Our client has identified this deliverable as beneficial to include in presentations or shared as part of future documentation to reach a wider audience.</p>

    <h1 class="homeSubHead" id="Documentation">Documentation</h1>
    <p class="generalText">To support our client, we will prepare documentation regarding the methodology used to execute our analysis and visualizations to provide further context to the project. The web map will aim to be as user-friendly as possible, but to ensure it is effective in portraying the story and is an interactive tool for the public to use, documentation will provide our client, who has identified themselves as not being familiar with GIS technology, crucial background information.</p>
