    <h1 class="homeSubHead" id="Data Collection and Research">Data Collection and Research</h1>
    <p class="generalText"> The first and often the most crucial step to any project is to define the scope as well as acquiring relevant data to support further processes. For creation of Team JPC's solution, the Greenbelt data was gathered from Ontario GeoHub while the study of the 10 at-risk locations was conducted by the members with thorough research.</p>
    <p class="generalText"> One of the initial challanges that the team faced was deciding on the open-source software to explore and use, with limited or none prior experience.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="grid2">
  <div class="gridcontent"  id="Creating a Basemap">
    <h1 class="homeSubHead">Creating a Basemap in Mapbox</h1>
    <p class="generalText"> To create a visually appealing webmap, the team needed a good basemap. Being limited to open-source software, JPC decided to utilize Mapbox for creation of a basemap as per requirements. </p>
    <p class="generalText"> After following a few tutorials, we were able to put together a basemap, or a style, as Mapbox defines it. Though this one didn't do any justice to our theme as it was created from a template which made it so that a lot of unnecessary data.</p>
    <div>
      <img class="methimg" src="Images/basemap1.png" alt="First basemap">
    </div>
    <p class="generalText">Instead of making a basemap from an existing style template, it wasa decided that a style would be created from a blank template to limit the excess data.</p>
    <p class="generalText"> With cartographic principles in mind, the team created a "style" which would make the viewer focus on the actual content of the layers to be added. This style contained colours which were easier on the eyes as well as elements that followed appropriate visual heirachy.</p>
    <div>
      <img class="methimg" src="Images/basemap2.png" alt="Second basemap">
    </div>
    <p class="generalText">With a positive response from all the members, this basemap was finalized.</p>
    <p class="generalText">Now, to add more context to the basemap, the members decided to try and figure out how to add data to Mapbox styles and symbolize it. For this, a demo dataset was used and points were placed on the basemap, with their markers able to be edited. With the use of some javascript to input an event listener which would work if the user clicked on a marker, displaying a pop-up with the description of that spot, acquired from the dataset.</p>
    <div>
      <img class="methimg" src="Images/basemap3.png" alt="Second basemap with markers">
    </div>
    <p class="generalText"> Following the same steps, the Greenbelt data downloaded from GeoHub was also uploaded as a geoJSON to be added to the basemap and provide a better context of where the Greenbelt lies.</p>
    <p class="generalText">This layer is classified into the following: Niagara Escarpment, Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan, Urban River Valley and Protected Countryside.</p>
    <div>
      <img class="methimg" src="Images/greenbeltgeoJSON.jpg" alt="Greenbelt on basemap">
    </div>
    <p class="generalText">With successful implementation of markers and pop-ups, the group chose to explore more features to create an interactive experience for the viewer.</p>
    <p class="generalText">As such, the team decided to tackle the task of creating a slideshow gallery in a marker tooltip, which would allow the user to switch between contextual images associated with the marker location. Here, we also tried to customise the markers with symbols and colours.</p>
    <div>
      <img class="methimg" src="Images/basemap4.png" alt="Slideshow gallery">
    </div>
    <p class="generalText">This last process was the most complex of all, requiring good knowledge of the code as compared to the others which were more reliant on Mapbox to do the work for them.</p>
  </div>

<div class="grid">
  <div class="gridcontent">
    <h1 class="homeSubHead" id="Digitizing">Digitizing the hotspot areas</h1>
    <p class="generalText">The digitizing component of this project will support the leaflet map on the solution page, which illustrates the polygons and lines of the proposed development zones which might harm the Greenbelt and Whitebelt.</p>
    <p class="generalText">Digitizing was originally done in the JOSM (Java OpenStreetMap) editor, but due to incompatibility with mapbox and leaflet,</p>
    <p class="generalText">Furthermore, JOSM has certain difficulties with polygon fill colour and file save format, preventing it from being identifiable from the basemap and other layer, as a result, it cannot be used in Mapbox or Leaflet.</p>
    <div>
      <img class="methimg" src="Images/JOSM.png" alt="JOSM editor made polygon">
    </div>
    <p class="generalText">The above picture only showed highligthed area when it is selected or certain presets were used.</p>
    <p class="generalText"> Eventually, to proceed with digitization Mapbox was utilised, which is plainly visible on the leaflet map with hotspot area markers.</p>
    <div>
      <img class="methimg" src="Images/Mapbox.png" alt="Mapbox made polygons">
    </div>
    <p class="generalText">All contested areas were digitised in Mapbox for efficiency of work and compatibility which made it easier to merge into the leaflet map.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="grid2">
  <div class="gridcontent">
    <h1 class="homeSubHead" id="Interactive Web Visualization">Interactive Web and Static Map Visualization</h1>
    <p class="generalText" id="Static Map Visualization">The Visualization phases of our project will be ongoing throughout the delivery of the final solutions. Our client has requested a visualization of the study area to be used as a tool to raise public awareness. We will look to meet this deliverable by providing an interactive web map as well as a supporting static map. The interactive web map will be developed using open-source technology and be delivered as a website that can be linked or embedded directly to their organizationâ€™s website. The interactive map will aim to tell a story, visualizing the results of our analysis as well as the additional information gathered through research of key metrics and the impacts of urban sprawl on the Greater Golden Horseshoe Area.  The interactive web map will be developed in stages along other key elements of the analysis. First creating the host webpage, incorporating base layers, then moving to including the results of our analysis as interactive layers and completing the story by adding in the additional information found from research and our analysis. The purpose of the static map is to provide an appealing, all-encompassing view of the study area to be viewed offline. Our client has identified this deliverable as beneficial to include in presentations or shared as part of future documentation to reach a wider audience.</p>

<div class="grid3">
  <div class="gridcontent">
    <h1 class="homeSubHead" id="Documentation">Documentation</h1>
    <p class="generalText">To support our client, we will prepare documentation regarding the methodology used to execute our analysis and visualizations to provide further context to the project. The web map will aim to be as user-friendly as possible, but to ensure it is effective in portraying the story and is an interactive tool for the public to use, documentation will provide our client, who has identified themselves as not being familiar with GIS technology, crucial background information.</p>
